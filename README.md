# Future 

- Working on getting an edit button working.  I'm pretty close to figuring it out for pure javascript and jQuery.  I could probably do it with React using setItem, event.target.value and the like, but I want to keep it in the spirit of the homework. We used a simple input editor that stored the name value to localStorage in RPG Adventurer's Academy
